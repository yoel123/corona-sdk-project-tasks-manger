this one came to me in a dream, I actually needed a tool like that
somthing that will show me project tasks one after the other and with a checkbox I can
tick if the task is done.

all from the comfort of a smartphone tablet or pc, the database is csv like.
thers also an editing screen inside the app (click the wrench button).

known issues:

*data update after edit dosnt show immidiatly.
not when i call the file db and not when i pass the data array from
the edit screen. perhaps a corona issue.
but the data dose update after reopen of app.

*large amount of tasks: no speed issue, but navegation, as there are
only next/previous buttons to navigate data.
this will start to be a problem above 30 screens.
will be solved next update.
